## Usage

Once the Project Creation Interface is running, it will display a menu where you can select the type of project you want to create. Simply enter the corresponding number for the project type you wish to create and follow the prompts.

### 1. C# Command Program (.NET 7.0)

This option allows you to create a C# command-line program using .NET 7.0. You will be prompted to enter the directory path where you want to create the project, as well as the name of the project. The program will then create the necessary files and folders for the C# command program.

### 2. Basic Website (HTML, CSS, JS)

Choose this option if you want to create a basic website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will be asked to enter the directory path where you want to create the project. The program will generate an index.html file, a style.css file, and a main.js file with basic code to get you started.

### 3. Forge Minecraft Mod (1.20.1)

If you want to create a Forge Minecraft Mod (version 1.20.1), select this option. You need an internet connection for this option. Enter the directory path where you want to create the project, and the program will download the necessary files from the internet and extract them to the specified directory.
